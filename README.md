# Spring Boot Interview Project

## Description
This project is a simple REST API application designed to demonstrate basic Spring Boot concepts.

## Objectives
- Walk us through the application flow and describe what each component does.
- Run the application.
- Call the application endpoint using the browser.
- Analyze the response. Did it return the expected data?
  - If not, what went wrong?
  - How can we fix it to make the tests pass?
